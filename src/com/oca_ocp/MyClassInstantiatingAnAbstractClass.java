//		An abstract class can never be instantiated. Its sole
//		purpose, mission in life, raison d'Ãªtre, is to be extended (subclassed). (Note,
//		however, that you can compile and execute an abstract class, as long as you don't
//		try to make an instance of it.)
//		For example, imagine you have a
//		class Car that has generic methods common to all vehicles. But you don't want
//		anyone actually creating a generic, abstract Car object
				
		
//		You can't mark a class as both abstract and final. They have nearly opposite
//		meanings. An abstract class must be subclassed, whereas a final class must not be
//		subclassed.
